	<p>Julia Tiplea knows grief.</p>
<p>In October, she mourned the death of her friend who was fatally shot in the Las Vegas concert shooting. She couldn’t go back to Las Vegas, where she grew up, to visit the vigils, light candles or lay down flowers.</p>
<p>But on Feb. 16, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas alumna carefully lit long white candles with her brother at the foot of a stage with 17 angel statues, adding to the sea of warm orange light flickering through Pine Trails Park. Her parents laid down the roses her dad had given her mom for Valentine’s Day.</p>
<p>Now, flower piles have grown in thick stacks to nearly cover the crosses. The browned petals are brittle from baking in the Florida sun, and candles have melted into wax piles. Red marker ink runs down handwritten cards, forced off the page by the spring rain. </p>
<figure>

<p>The city is different. People walk around wearing maroon and silver Stoneman Douglas T-shirts. Donation boxes for victims are at the local Publix. Manicured lawns have maroon and silver flowers shaped into hearts or the letters “MSD.” </p>
<p>Kids know, too. At Pine Trails on a sunny day in March, a woman walked alongside the piles of flowers and cards with a young boy wearing a backpack half his size. </p>
<p>“That’s Joaquin,” he said, pointing at a candle with an attached photo of smiling 17-year-old Joaquin Oliver, a victim of the shooting. </p>
<p>She watched the kid make his way alongside the flowers and candles, passing cards with tiny painted handprints. </p>
<p>“What does it mean that there’s a lot of stuff?” the woman asked the boy, who was wandering ahead. “That there’s a lot of people that love them, right?”</p>
<p>Yet at the park, away from the 17 wooden crosses and Stars of David under their blue tents, children played soccer. Parents and friends sweat on the sidelines. </p>
<figure>

<p>They’ll pass out water bottles, maybe orange slices, and go home like they’ve done before.
The city won’t forget, but things are shifting to a new normal. A normal where banners from around the nation declaring support hang on the school’s chain-link fence alongside advertisements for local dentists and restaurants.  </p>
<p>“Parkland won’t really ever go back to what it was,” said Tiplea, a 19-year-old UF marine science sophomore. “But it’ll come back stronger.”</p>
<p>When Tiplea transferred to Stoneman Douglas in 2014, she felt overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Even though Parkland is about 20 times smaller than Las Vegas, the school of about 3,000 was nearly triple the size of her old high school. She eased herself into Stoneman  Douglas, joining the cheer team and making friends in class. </p>
<p>When she reflects on high school, she still thinks of junior year in the school gym for cheer practice and senior year eating lunch in the debate room with friends. </p>
<p>“Douglas just kind of stands out to me now, looking back, just the fact that it’s a close-knit community,” she said. “It’s a special place.”</p>
<p>Learning about the shooting paralyzed her. Tiplea, who missed the initial calls from her dad and texts from Parkland friends while in the shower, could do nothing but cry. </p>
<p>Message after message poured in, asking about her brother Luke. Tiplea didn’t know how to react. She called her dad, who was at work in another city and couldn’t get to the school. </p>
<p>Tiplea and her parents texted her brother, who hid in a closet, listening to the gunfire but untouched by it. As he updated them on his location, she thought how lucky they were they could talk. The cell phone service was always bad in school.</p>
<p>Despite losing her friend Quinton Robbins in the Las Vegas shooting, Tiplea felt the Parkland shooting was more personal. Her brother was in the building. The shooter was arrested outside of her neighborhood.</p>
<p>Still in Gainesville, Tiplea tried to sleep that night but couldn’t. She didn’t know who had lived or died. When people didn’t respond, she didn’t know if it was because they had dropped their phone running or if they were a victim.</p>
<p>She stayed up, texting her friends about their siblings, trying to piece together what had happened and who had been hurt. </p>
<p>The next morning, Tiplea and a friend made the five hour drive home in silence, both trying to process around what had happened.  </p>
<p>At home in Parkland, she stayed up until 1:30 a.m., talking and crying with her family in their living room as they held each other close. </p>
<p>“Time just feels like it’s been almost standing still and flown by,” she said.</p>
<p>The names of those who died came out late Thursday night: Carmen Schentrup, the younger sister of a former classmate of Tiplea’s; Coach Aaron Feis, who greeted Tiplea and other students with a “good morning” each day as he opened the gates; Nicholas Dworet, who she remembered swimming in the lane next to her each practice at the Coral Springs Aquatic Complex. </p>
<p>This year, Dworet was the swimming team captain, posing for a photo with her brother, a sophomore on the team.  </p>
<p>“Seeing his name really hurt,” she said. </p>
<p>While she was home, her family tried to maintain a sense of normalcy. They went to Church by the Glades and her younger brother’s soccer game. It felt good to be outside, she said. She saw old friends of hers who also came back to Parkland to grieve. Though she was happy to be reunited, it was sobering to meet at the memorial for the 17 victims. </p>
<p>Over Spring Break, when she came home again, the town still felt different. Everyone knows what happened. Even if they don’t directly talk about it, the mourning hangs thick in the air, ever-present. </p>
<p>Tiplea didn’t go by Stoneman Douglas during Spring Break. It’s eerie seeing the lines of cars with hazard lights flashing, all the people around the memorials, seeing the well-wishes and cards tied to the chain-link fence next to regular school signs.</p>
<p>“It’s been a rough few months, I won’t lie,” she said. “I want to make sure no one ever has to feel the way I’m feeling.”</p>
<p>It’s not that she wants to forget. Tiplea just wishes she could go a day without thinking about the Parkland shooting, thinking about the terror in familiar hallways.</p>
<p>Every time she opens Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, she sees her friends posting about Stoneman Douglas, the March For Our Lives and the Never Again movement. While Tiplea has immersed herself in it as part of the UF stands with MSD group, she wishes she could have her old daily routine back. </p>
<p>“It’s just hard to kind of get back to your regular life when something like this happens in your community,” she said.</p>
<p>She and other Stoneman Douglas alumni from her graduating class have organized a bus trip to Washington, D.C., a vigil on campus and T-shirt sales as part of the UF Stands with MSD group. The group raised about $18,000.</p>
<p>It helps her feel like she’s making progress.</p>
<p>About 12 hours before Tiplea and 112 other UF students would board two buses and head to Washington, other leaders in the UF stands with MSD group passed out T-shirts and joked about how badly they needed to pack. </p>
<p>Alyson Moriarty, a UF biology freshman who went to Monarch High School in Coconut Creek, handed out shirts between flipping through her red Smokin’ Notes Biology 2 packet. She had an exam that night at 6:30 p.m., moved from Friday so she could march. </p>
<p>She’ll carry a white poster board with black text saying, “When is the last ‘I Love You,’” and a drawing of a text message saying “There’s a shooter. I love you.”</p>
<p>Until she started working to organize students, Moriarty felt like she wasn’t allowed to feel anything but pain. </p>
<p>“I felt like I couldn’t really smile or anything,” she said.</p>
<p>But nearly a month later, Moriarty laughed with Jaimie Ivers and Brandon Taylor, two other leaders in the UF Stands with MSD group, about being unprepared for Washington’s cold weather and what snacks they’d packed. </p>
<p>Ivers, a Stoneman Douglas alumna and Tiplea’s roommate, didn’t return home to Parkland until Spring Break. Back in the town she’d lived in all her life, she couldn’t bring herself to go to the memorials at Stoneman Douglas or Pine Trails. It was too hard. </p>
<p>Still, Parkland was eerie, and although she didn’t go inside Douglas, in a small town like Parkland, where Douglas is the center of the city, passing it was unavoidable, she said. </p>
<p>“The attitude, just the entire atmosphere is entirely different,” Ivers, a 20-year-old UF public relations sophomore, said. “It’s all anyone can talk about.”</p>
<p>In the few days after the shooting, Ivers kept crying. Seeing the high school students who spearheaded the March For Our Lives — students who she’d had drama classes with — inspired her to take action.</p>
<p>“I needed to get over myself and get my s--- together and help everyone,” she said. </p>
<p>As others passed out T-shirts, Tiplea rushed back and forth from her apartment to the post office, shipping out shirt orders that came in from New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and all across Florida.</p>
<p>On Saturday, in the nation’s capital, she’ll march alongside other UF students and Douglas alumni, one of the anticipated hundreds of thousands of attendees.</p>

</figure>
<p>She doesn’t have a sign for the march yet. By Thursday night, she still hadn’t packed. But, still, she feels ready.</p>
<p>Tiplea doesn’t know what future will come after the march but thinks there will be change.
She knows her friends, family and hometown will never forget. But she feels things slowly becoming okay again, as OK as things can be after tragedy. </p>
<p>“Relief will just come with time, and I’m going to give it that time,” she said. </p>

	<p>Michael Weissman, a UF finance freshman, graduated from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last year. He still has friends in the school, and when the Valentine’s Day shooting started at about 2 p.m., the 18-year-old was in class.</p>
	<p>“My phone kept buzzing and buzzing and buzzing. I thought maybe it was just a group. I look down to maybe shut it off, and I just see ‘there’s a shooter at Douglas, there’s a shooter at Douglas.’ This was an actual thing that was happening. This wasn’t an Onion article. I put in my headphones and listened to one clip and then I just walked out of class. I texted everyone I knew: friends, teachers who were club sponsors. I just kept asking people if they were ok. For those that responded, and there were some that didn’t respond that was concerning, there were some that were saying they heard shots. There was some people who heard more than others, there were some people who didn’t know what was happening, people who are hiding.”</p>

<p>For four weekends in a row after the Parkland shooting, Harrison Cohn, a UF finance freshman, drove home to visit his alma mater and be with his grieving community. His brother attends Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. This weekend, he boarded a bus to Washington, D.C. to participate in March For Our Lives.</p>
<p>“I told my brother to stay strong. I told him to be there for his classmates, and they will be there for him. Going back to school where that happened is hard. I know one of my good friends was in the room when the shooting happened. She’s be on edge since it happened. When she goes to the gym, and she hears a loud bang, she has to run out. Luckily, for my brother he didn’t have to see anything. He heard the gunshots. They were loud, and you could hear them from anywhere in the school. I told him to stay strong and go back there. Douglas is a great school. You have to go back and represent us as a community. If everyone goes back, it shows how strong we are."</p>

<p>Jaimie Ivers, a UF public relations sophomore, helped plan the bus trip for UF students after she posted on Facebook student groups to find students interested in going. She said she did it because she wants to support her alma mater Stoneman Douglas.</p>
<p>
“Cameron Kasky, one of the Stoneman Douglas students leading the #NeverAgain movement, lives three doors down from me. I was in drama with him and Alex Wind, and now they are on the cover of Time. When all the #NeverAgain kids started, it inspired me to do something here at UF. Details about the shooter and his life made it clear he is not someone who should have a gun. It’s not even just one issue, it’s so many: lack of communication, mental health. There was so many things wrong with the situation, something needed to be done. The result of the march should be a change in our laws, but I think it will take time. It won’t happen all of a sudden, but a march on Washington is part of it. It’s everyone that participates. There’s been people reaching out. There’s an overwhelming amount of people of all ages. The fact that it is happening worldwide is a good thing because I think we need to see how embarrassing that this happens here. I hope America is embarrassed.”</p>

<p>Ricardo Rauseo, a UF political science and international studies senior and student senator, heard about the bus trip and said he needed to go to represent other students.</p>
<p>“I was interested because that high school was 20 minutes away from my home in Weston. I decided this is something I care about and this is a movement I can get behind. This type of peaceful protest doesn’t happen in my home country, Venezuela. I’m going to see how it is in the United States. I went to the Richard Spencer protest last year, so this will be my second protest. The media has framed it has been ‘These high schoolers are kids, they don’t know the law. We are adults; we are the ones that make the law.’ If you are old enough to be a victim of gun violence, then you are old enough to see gun laws change. People say ‘They can’t vote,’ but they are still part of our society, and if that were the case, we wouldn’t have any laws regarding kids at all. No one deserves to go through what they went through.”</p>

	<p>As Adam Rachlin, a UF political science and family, youth and community sciences sophomore and Stoneman Douglas alumnus, rides a bus more than 12 hours to march in D.C., he poured over pages of a book about the Second Amendment, highlighting quotes he thought was meaningful, so he can “understand the other side.”</p>
	<p>“When it comes to gun reform, it’s something I’ve studied for roughly the past five or six years, even before any of this happened. When the shooting in Aurora, Colorado, where a man shot up a movie theater, happened, it really affected me. Since then I’ve been trying to figure out why this happens, why people have access to these types of guns. I want to march for this because one of the pillars of ‘March For Our Lives’ is a ban an assault weapons. It’s a controversial idea, but I think it’s something that needs to happen. Not only is it apparent that these weapons are only used for mass destruction or mass killings, there is no other use for them. The Second Amendment is a very loose amendment. It’s the shortest of the amendments. Just because something back in the day made sense, it might not make sense anymore, and I think politicians need to see that. Organizations like the National Rifle Association need to stay out of politics. That’s what is making these politicians lean more toward a loose gun reform agenda. Through March For Our Lives, people are showing they don’t want that anymore. They want more gun reform. Ninety-seven percent of the population agrees we should have universal background checks, especially when it comes to gun shows, where you can go and buy a gun really easily. Stuff like that needs to be regulated more. I’m not only marching for the 17 lives, but for any life taken through gun violence. This isn’t just about school shootings, this is about shootings that happen in communities where gun violence is an everyday thing. The outcry for help is very apparent from how many people are going to march. It’s not just people from Parkland, it’s people from every city in the entire county. That’s so important, and it’s so important to be a part of this. That’s why I march." </p>

	<p>Eleven-year-old Aagmeya Banerjee brought a crowd of about 1,250 to its feet.</p>
<p>Not only was he the youngest speaker, but he was the only one to receive a standing ovation at the Gainesville March For Our Lives at Bo Diddley Community Plaza on Saturday. Banerjee addressed politicians who don’t take children seriously in the discussion of gun reform.</p>
<p>“Stop talking to kids like we are idiots,” he told them.</p>
<p>Banerjee was among the marchers who spilled into West University Avenue at about 2 p.m. to protest gun violence and demand stricter gun laws in Gainesville. The demonstration was one of more than 840 protests worldwide as marchers called for stricter gun laws and to weaken the National Rifle Association’s political influence. </p>
<p>Before marching, protesters rallied on Bo Diddley Plaza, listening to calls for action from political candidates, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School alumni and local officials. Participants were encouraged to donate blood at the blood bus and register to vote at the Alachua County Supervisor of Elections booth.</p>
<p>As she marched, Penelope Dobbins, a sixth-grader at Millhopper Montessori School, raised her voice to the point of cracking as she pleaded for stricter gun laws.</p>
<p>When Penelope watches the news, she sees the U.S. crumbling apart, she said. Although she feels safe going to school, she worries about other children who attend schools with less security. </p>
<p>But Saturday’s march put a smile on her face and hope in her heart. Politicians will be forced to listen, and change will come, she said. </p>
<p>“We’re demanding action, and we’re going to keep chanting until they hear us,” she said. </p>
<p>While one speaker urged Congress to criminalize bump stocks, Mike Ryan Simonovich, a Gainesville resident, bent over to explain what a bump stock is to his 8-year-old son Yuri. </p>
<p>Yuri is accustomed to the large crowds and thunderous cheers that come with protests. He typically tags along with his father to marches, polls and city meetings. Yuri said he likes attending the rallies and meetings with his father but prefers the shorter ones. </p>
<p>“I don’t like walking for a long time,” Yuri said. </p>
<p>Ryan Simonovich feels it’s his duty to educate his second-grade son about political issues because he belongs to the next generation of voters. He was thrilled to see so many young people advocating for change. He said he believes the Gainesville protesters sent a strong message. </p>
<p>“I hope that it terrifies the politicians who are in the pockets of the NRA,” he said.</p>
<p>No arrests or injuries were reported during the march, said Gainesville Police Department Lt. Jaret Weiland. The event was calm, even with the occasional counter protester, he said. </p>
<p>GPD’s main safety concern was how the march would affect traffic as protestors spilled from the sidewalks into the street. Although the department did not initially plan to block off roads, officers partially blocked off the right lane of West University Avenue. They were stationed along the march route to keep marchers close to the curb, Weiland said. </p>
<p>Bruce Frendahl, a 65-year-old retired architect, watched history repeat itself as he stood on the sidewalk next to Bo Diddley Plaza. As protesters poured into the center of the plaza, Frendahl recalled the Vietnam protests led by his fellow UF students in the 1970s. He said activism moves in cycles. </p>
<p>“It’s coming back around. This is the issue that’s firing up the students,” he said. </p>
<p>Frendahl tacked a picture of his two grandkids, 10-year-old Abby and 8-year-old Joey, to the middle of his deep blue sign that read, “My grandkids will attend that school. Will it be safe for them then?”</p>
<p>Abby and Joey live in Coral Springs in the same school district as Marjory Stoneman Douglas. Frendahl said arming teachers will not keep his grandchildren safe – only gun reform can. </p>
<p>“I just pray to God to keep them safe, and my daughter is doing everything she can to keep them safe,” Frendahl said. “There’s nothing more that we can do.”</p>
<p>Behind many chants along the march were the tribal rhythms of 50-year-old Patrick Brezyan and his djembe, a bongo-style drum of African origin. </p>
<p>For nearly two decades, Brezyan has been bringing his goat-skin Ghanaian djembe to marches all across the U.S., from Chicago to New York City to Gainesville, where the percussionist has lived for the past year and a half.</p>
<p>He said he played his djembe along to protesters’ chants Saturday afternoon not for attention, but for unity, a call to action through rhythm.</p>
<p>"The drum can be a powerful thing in a place like this," he said. "It's a tribal thing. It's innate in our bones. It calls on people to come together." </p>
